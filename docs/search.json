It is not only being able to talk about the results of data but also manipulating it efficient ways.\nI think data scientists and statisticians both use statistical methods to analyze data in order to solve real-world problems. However, I think statisticians are more focused on the mathematical rigor behind the analysis whereas data scientists are more focused on the machine learning and process improvements to solve the analysis.\nI would say I am a healthy blend of both areas. As a Marketing Analyst I am always making sure my methodologies have statistical significance and are deployed correctly but at the same time I am constantly updating and improving upon my processes to make the job easier in the future."
